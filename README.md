Introductory Steps

Step01: Specify the Main Design Challenge 

What is the main activity your project would support the users in accomplishing?
The project will allow users to gain a broader understanding about U.S. politics and clarify the functions of Congress and how laws are made. This will help to serve particularly middle school students, but will also be beneficial to people who are unfamiliar and new to the concept of government in the United States. 

What is the basic need involved for that activity?
This activity helps user's need to understand how politics functions. In order to be a functioning and responsible member of society, it is integral for people to understand how their government works and they ways in which they can affect political outcomes. 

What is/are the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
Current traditional solutions is looking at informational webpages such as Wikipedia and also asking members of one's community about information regarding the government. Many people also learn about government and politics in their educational schooling system. 

What is/are the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?
The approaches mentioned above prove to be difficult because information online proves to be quite dense and also there is possibility for misinformation to be dissemenated by word of mouth. This website will help improve ease of access to information that is credible. 

Step02: Identify Target Users 

What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise)
Demographic: People who are in elementary-high school or people who have low knowledge on politics. Students. 
Preferences: Users have a desire to learn more about government and politics which will lead them to seek out sources of information regarding that topic. 
Expertise: Users don't need a certain level of expertise to use this product, however they will most likely have low expertise on the subject itself. 

Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)
Users will do this activity on their phone or mobile device when they need quick information. They will also access this product online through their laptop or desktop when doing research or completing an activity for school. 

What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)
Users would find both broad and specific information by clicking on the website and combing through the tabs to find what they were looking for. 

Step03: Pick research methods (or a combination of methods) 
I used participatory observation and ethnographic research: 
Ethnographic research: I observed my subject finding information about a certain topic that they were interested in and how they navigated the site. 

Participatory Observation Research:

Reflection: 
I like learning more about the individual desires and challenges of my subject. I enjoyed how it felt personal and I really got to understand a user's perspective. I liked how the conversation was open and there was dialogue, which is different from just watching them and not actually engaging in conversation. It was cool to interview and ask questions because my subject seemed really open and honest and I was able to really take their considerations to heart. My subject was something short on his responses which was frustrating but I asked him to elaborate more on his answers and that helped. The data showed me that my subject really likes to use resources such as youtube, a video platform, rather than reading information.
